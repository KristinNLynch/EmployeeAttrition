Using Supervised Machine Learning to predict Employee Attrition

During the pandemic, many companies cut employees as sales started to fall drastically. People were left jobless and afraid to leave their house. 
As things improved, many of these people didn't return to work. Those that stayed took on even more responsibilities while they often faced additional responsibilities
like homeschooling their children, caring for sick family members and having to deal with inflation. Soon, as sales returned to normal, or even better than normal rates, 
employees had the upper hand. Market rates increased and they started to leave for better positions and more money.

What if employers could predict employee attrition? What if they could tell how many of their workforce was at risk for leaving? In this project, I've tested machine learning algorithms to test employee data to predict attrition.  This could help them to evaulate salaries in the market, up retention efforts and do more to retain their current quality employees since hiring and training is much more expensive.

These data sources were from Kaggle.
